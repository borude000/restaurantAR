# Compressed Models

This folder is generated by the compression step:

- Run `npm run models:compress` to compress `.glb/.gltf` from `client/public/models/` into this folder.
- Use these paths in production for faster loading, e.g. `/models-compressed/dish.glb`.
- If you have USDZ for iOS, copy it here as well and pass via `iosSrc` to `ModelViewer`.
